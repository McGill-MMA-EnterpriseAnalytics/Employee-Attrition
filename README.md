# Employee-Attrition

**📌 Project Overview**

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for businesses, leading to high hiring and training costs. In this project, we leverage machine learning, clustering, and causal inference to analyze and predict employee turnover using HR data. Our goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention.

**🔍 Objectives**

Supervised Learning (Classification) – Predict the probability of an employee leaving the company.

Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) – Identify employee segments based on attrition risk factors.

Causal Inference (DoWhy, CausalML) – Understand the impact of interventions (e.g., salary increases, promotions) on attrition.

**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Feature Distributions – Salary, total working years, job satisfaction trends.

Attrition Breakdown – Department, gender, and promotion impact.

Correlation Analysis – Identifying key drivers of attrition.

Clustering Readiness – PCA and optimal K-means cluster selection.

Causal Inference Preparation – Treatment vs. control group comparisons.
